# Achieve Dramatic Printing!
---
Hello! This is a class that would provide a `print()` function (weird, huh) that would add extra delay after each character printed!
To use this as the normal print, simply override it like this:
```python
from dramaprint import Dramaprint as printObj
print = printObj
```
